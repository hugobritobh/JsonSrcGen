# JsonSrcGen
Json library that uses .NET 5 c# Source Generators

Note: Requires the .Net 5 Preview to run. Mono platforms do not have support for the .Net 5 Source Generators yet.

# Supported Types

**Classes**
Class serializers can be generated by defining a Json attribute on the class
```csharp
[Json]
public class MyType
{
    [JsonName("my_name")]
    public string MyProperty {get;set}

    [JsonIgnore]
    public string IgnoredProperty {get;set;}
}
```
Properties with the following types are supported:

Integer Types | Others
------|--------
int |  float 
int? | float?
uint | double
uint? | double?
ushort | boolean
ushort? | boolean?
short | string
short? | DateTime
byte | DateTime?
byte? | Guid
long | Arrays
long? | List<T>
    
**Arrays**

Arrays are generated by defining a JsonArray attribute at the assembly level.

```csharp
[assembly: JsonArray(typeof(bool))]
```

**List**

Lists are generated by defining a JsonList attribute at the assembly level.

```csharp
[assembly: JsonList(typeof(bool))]
```

**Dictionary**

Dictionaries are generated by defining a JsonList attribute at the assembly level. Only Dictionaries with string keys are supported currently.

```csharp
[assembly: JsonDictionary(typeof(string), typeof(int))]
```

**Nuget Packages**

JsonSrcGen is available as a nuget package:
