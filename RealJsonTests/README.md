The tests in this folder are based on Json from real APIs

If you would like to ensure your Json API works with JsonSrcGen then you can submit your tests to be included here via a merge request. The JsonSrcGen developers will ensure that any tests included here pass for each new release.

Tests must meet the following criteria:
* Use nunit
* Use local json data (no external API calls from the tests)

API's are eligible for free inclusion under any of the following conditions:
* The API is available to the public free of charge.
* The server or client code is available under an OSI approved opensource licence.

If your API does not meet the above conditions please contacts the maintainers to discus how you can support the development in exchange for having your tests included.
